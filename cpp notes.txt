Data types and type modifiers

We know that to store any data in memory we can store them with the help of variables and we can later change them.

But we have different type of data hence we need different datatypes

int,float,double

int for integers 

float for decimal numbers upto 7 decimals precision

double for decimal numbers upto 15 decimals precision

we can also store char and bool for character and boolean

int takes 4 bytes

float takes 4 bytes

double takes 8 bytes

But we can modify these with type modifiers like short and long as per our need

short int a;//takes only 2 bytes

usinged this only chnages the range not the size.

what are namespaces?

For example we want to have two variables with same name but this will cause the name conflict

hence to avoid the name conflict we can use the namespaces

syntax

namespace <name of namespace> {
    //all the variables and the functions 
}

using namespace <name of namespace>

now we can use the all the variables and functions 

another way to do this is 

<name of namespace>::<variables or functions>

header files contain the declaration and implementation files contain the defination 

we need to inclue the header files like this "headerfile.h"

in the implementation file we need to inclue the header file also 


jumps in the loops 

we are having two types of jumps one is break and other is continue

using the break we will get out the loop or basically we will terminate the loop

using the continue we will skip that particular iteration only.
